It should enliven us.” - Dean Spade, <em>Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During this Crisis (and the Next)</em></p>\n<p>JOIN US!!!</p>\n<h1>Our History</h1>\n<p>UES CAN was co-founded in July 2025 by 20+ neighbors, many of whom first convened in late 2024 over concerns about increased state repression. We organized ourselves into a mutual aid group, creating a space in which every voice matters and decisions are made collectively to directly impact our community. Our early initiatives included providing food & water to neighbors and raising funds to support those in need.</p>\n<h1>Current Initiatives</h1>\n<h1>Join us!</h1>\n<p>Contact information or link to google docs/form link</p>\n<p>// testing images below (hoping it works)-also side note, does anyone know what these are?</p>\n<div class=\"notion-image\"><img src=\"./images/image_260958f09a308068b1c5f648347344f7.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;\"></div>",
