It should enliven us.” - Dean Spade, <em>Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During this Crisis (and the Next)</em></p>\n<p>JOIN US!!!</p>\n<h2>Our History</h2>\n<p>UES CAN was co-founded in July 2025 by 20+ neighbors, many of whom first convened in late 2024 over concerns about increased state repression. We organized ourselves into a mutual aid group, creating a space in which every voice matters and decisions are made collectively to directly impact our community. Our early initiatives included providing food & water to neighbors and raising funds to support those in need.</p>\n<h2>Initiatives</h2>\n<h2>Join us!</h2>\n<p>Contact information or link to google docs/form <a href=\"https://www.pentagram.com/work/a-data-love-letter-to-the-subway\" target=\"_blank\">link</a></p>",
